Steps to add Edit functionality:

Identify the item to edit

In your Data component (where you list the entries), add an Edit button beside each item.

When clicked, call a function (passed down from App) with the index or unique id of that item.

Lift the edit state up to App

In App, keep a state like editIndex (default null).

When user clicks "Edit", set editIndex to that item’s index.

Pass edit data to Form

When rendering Form, check if editIndex is not null.

If yes, fetch that item’s data from localStorage/storedData and prefill the form with it.

Handle form submit for edit mode

If editIndex is null → treat it as Add new entry.

If editIndex has a value → update that entry in storedData instead of adding a new one.

After saving, reset editIndex back to null.

Sync with localStorage

After updating the entry in storedData, update localStorage as well (just like you do with add/delete).

Navigation

After editing is done, navigate back to Data page to see the updated list.
